Fluffy Spheres is an attempt to learn OpenGL graphics programming using OpenGL.
The goal is to eventually make a 3D puzzle game, involving a fluffy sphere that has to
acomplish several tasks around different courses.

## Requirements ##
python2.x, any version should work

These libraries are also required:  
[pygame](http://www.pygame.org/news.html "pygame")  
[PyOpenGL](http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/ "PyOpenGL")  

## TODO ##
* Textures
* Bottom plane (in prog)
* Collision (in prog)
* Level design
* UI design (menu)
* Cross-plattform font library ()
* Make the camera follow the sphere (in prog)
* Look in different directions using mouse (in prog)

Maybe look into alternative frameworks to GLUT, such as [freeglut](http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/ "freeglut"),
[GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/ "GLFW") and [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/ "GLEW").
